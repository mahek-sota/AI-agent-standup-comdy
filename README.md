## Multi-Agent conversation - Standup Comedy

Multi-Agent Comedy Creator is a conversational AI backend that simulates a collaborative stand-up comedy writing session between two distinct agents. Using the power of large language models and multi-agent orchestration, this system enables a dynamic, back-and-forth ideation flowâ€”similar to two comedians brainstorming and riffing on jokes in real time.
